Importing Modules:

import random
from wsgiref.util import guess_scheme
random module is used to randomly choose a word from a list.

guess_scheme is imported from wsgiref.util, but it is not used in the code, so this line can be removed.

List of Words:

words = ['python', 'java', 'flask', 'django', 'javascript', 'cpp', 'swift', 'ruby']
A list of words that the game can choose from.

Choosing a Word:

chosen_word = random.choice(words)  # Randomly choose a word from the list
Randomly selects one word from the words list to be the hidden word.

Setting Up the Display:

word_display = ['_' for i in chosen_word]
Creates a list of underscores (_) representing the hidden word. The length of the list is equal to the length of the chosen word.

Setting Attempts:

attempts = 5    # Giving 5 attempts to user
Initializes the number of attempts the user has to guess the word.

Game Introduction:

print("Welcome to Hangman!")
Main Game Loop:

while attempts > 0 and '_' in word_display:
    print("\n" + " ".join(word_display))
    guess = input("Enter a letter: ").lower()
    if guess in chosen_word:
        for index, letter in enumerate(chosen_word):
            if letter == guess:
                word_display[index] = guess
    else:
        print("That letter doesn't appear in the word")
        attempts -= 1
        if attempts > 0:
            print(f"You have more {attempts} attempts to guess the word")
        else:
            print("You ran out of attempts")
The loop continues as long as the user has attempts left and there are underscores in word_display.

Displays the current state of the word with guessed letters.

Prompts the user to input a letter.

If the guessed letter is in the chosen word, it updates word_display to reveal the letter.

If the guessed letter is not in the chosen word, it reduces the number of attempts and informs the user.

End of Game:

if '_' not in word_display:
    print("You guessed the word!")
    print(" ".join(word_display))
    print("You survived!")
else:
    print(f"The word was '{chosen_word}'")
    print("You lost")
Checks if the user has guessed the word by looking for underscores in word_display.

If there are no underscores, the user has guessed the word correctly and wins.

If there are still underscores and the user has run out of attempts, the user loses, and the hidden word is revealed.

Summary:
The code implements a simple Hangman game. The user has 5 attempts to guess a randomly chosen word from a list. 
The user inputs one letter at a time, and the game reveals the correct letters in the word while reducing attempts for incorrect guesses. 
The game ends when the user either correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
